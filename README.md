Project's Title: # SwallowtailTea

<!-- description of project-->
This is a Swallowtail tea website replica.
The original site is: https://swallowtailtea.com/

<!-- issues -->
this project is replicated using Web dev introduction level skill.
many function from the orignal site are not implemented in this replica.

The website is not very responsive to anything outside of web size 1440px
shrinking or expaning the size will cause the page to become unproportional.
A media query of 400px is implemented, but only works on the top of the page.
Links in this project will not direct you to any sub page, due to there is only 
1 page being designed.

<!-- future proof -->
this project is made with future improvement in mind,
files in partials are to help create a uniform layout.
css and javascript all have same name as the main ejs file
to help referencing them when in need.

The only functional javaScript feature is the hover background changing feature.
